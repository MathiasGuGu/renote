ðŸ“‹ System Architecture Overview
1. Document Selection & Preferences System
User-controlled selection: Allow users to choose which Notion pages/databases to monitor for question generation
Document categories: Support different question types per document type (notes, meeting minutes, research, etc.)
Frequency settings: Per-document or per-user scheduling preferences (daily, weekly, on-change)
Content filters: Skip documents under X words, archived items, etc.
2. Change Detection & Incremental Processing
Content hashing: Store MD5/SHA hashes of document content to detect actual changes
Timestamp comparison: Use Notion's last_edited_time for quick change detection
Incremental updates: Only process changed sections, not entire documents
Version tracking: Keep track of which version of a document was last processed
3. Job Queue & Background Processing
Queue system: Use Redis + Bull/BullMQ or database-based queue (PostgreSQL + pg-boss)
Job types:
Sync jobs (fetch latest content)
Analysis jobs (generate questions)
Cleanup jobs (remove old data)
Priority system: User-triggered > scheduled > bulk processing
Rate limiting: Respect both Notion API and AI service limits
4. AI Question Generation Pipeline
Content preprocessing: Clean/chunk content, extract key sections
Question types: Multiple choice, short answer, essay questions, flashcards
Batch processing: Process multiple documents in single AI calls when possible
Quality filtering: Score and filter generated questions for relevance
6. Scheduling Strategy
Multi-tier scheduling:
Real-time: User-triggered manual syncs
Frequent: Changed documents (every 15-30 minutes)
Regular: Full account sync (daily)
Deep: Full reprocessing (weekly)
Smart scheduling: More frequent updates for actively edited documents
User timezone awareness: Schedule heavy processing during user's off-hours
7. Performance Optimizations
Caching layers: Cache AI responses, processed content, question sets
Parallel processing: Process multiple documents simultaneously with worker pools
Content chunking: Break large documents into smaller sections for processing
AI call optimization: Batch similar requests, use cheaper models for preprocessing
8. Monitoring & User Experience
Progress tracking: Real-time updates on sync and processing status
Error reporting: Clear error messages and retry options for users
Question quality feedback: Allow users to rate questions to improve AI prompts
Processing history: Show users what was processed when and why
9. Cost Management
Token estimation: Calculate AI costs before processing
Usage limits: Per-user monthly limits on AI processing
Intelligent prompting: Use smaller models for classification, larger for generation
Content filtering: Skip low-value content (headers, footers, navigation)
10. Scalability Considerations
Horizontal scaling: Design workers to scale across multiple servers
Database partitioning: Partition by user_id for large-scale deployment
CDN integration: Cache static content and AI responses
Resource pools: Shared AI service connections and rate limiting
ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Tech Stack
Background Jobs: PostgreSQL + pg-boss (native to your current stack)
AI Integration: OpenAI API with fallback to Anthropic
Caching: Redis for frequently accessed data
Monitoring: Built-in job status tracking + error logging
Scheduling: Node.js cron jobs + database-driven scheduling
ðŸš€ Implementation Phases
Phase 1: Basic question generation for single documents (manual trigger)
Phase 2: Background job system with simple scheduling
Phase 3: Smart change detection and incremental processing
Phase 4: Advanced AI optimization and multiple question types
Phase 5: User preferences, quality feedback, and advanced scheduling
This architecture would provide a robust, scalable foundation that can handle multiple users processing hundreds of documents while keeping costs manageable and providing a great user experience.
